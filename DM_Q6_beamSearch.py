# nrooks.py : Solve the N-Rooks/N-Queens problem!
# Prerna, August 2016(Modified Dr. Crandall's code)
#
# The N-rooks problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N rooks on the board so that no rooks
# can take any other, i.e. such that no two rooks share the same row or column.


# The N-Queens problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N rooks on the board so that no queens
# can take any other, i.e. such that no two queens share the same row or column or diagonal.
# This is N, the size of the board.
